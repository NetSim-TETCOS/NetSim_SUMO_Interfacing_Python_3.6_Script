This file is a part of Netsim code. It uses libraries to establish TCP connection between Sumo and python, and get/modify data dynamically
Sumo is a free software, however Netsim is a commercial software. Users are not advised to modify the code, however they can use this code
to learn about the Sumo libraries, basic file reading/writing operations in python etc.

#Common Libraries
#	<os>
"""
This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. If you just want to read or write a file see open(),
if you want to manipulate paths, see the os.path module, and if you want to read all the lines in all the files on the command line see the file input
module. For creating temporary files and directories see the temp file module, and for high-level file and directory handling see the shutil module.
"""

#	<sys>
"""
This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
 It is always available
"""

#	<time>
"""
This module provides various time-related functions. For related functionality, see also the date time and calendar modules.
Although this module is always available, not all functions are available on all platforms. Most of the functions defined in this module call platform C library
functions with the same name. It may sometimes be helpful to consult the platform documentation, because the semantics of these functions varies among platforms.
"""

#	<subprocess>
"""
The subprocess module allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes. This module intends to replace
several older modules and functions:
